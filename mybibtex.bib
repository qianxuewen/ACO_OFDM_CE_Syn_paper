  abstract      = {Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC) is a multicarrier modulation technique characterized by a prototype filter that can be optimized either in time or in frequency, depending on the target application and/or on the dispersion of the channel. FBMC is often referred as a non-orthogonal modulation technique as symbols overlap in the time domain and as adjacent subcarriers overlap in the frequency domain. This structural absence of orthogonality at the transmitter implies no need for Cyclic Prefix (CP), increasing the bandwidth efficiency of FBMC systems. In cellular systems, Multi-User (MU) downlink cooperation between cells (CoMP) enables to provide a good quality of service to cell edge users while maintaining a high spectral efficiency in the system. For MU-CoMP, time and frequency synchronization between cooperating Base Stations (BSs) and the User Equipment (UE) is a crucial mandatory step. In this study, where synchronization for CoMP with FBMC is considered, it is demonstrated that the UE can robustly estimate very large delays and arbitrary high carrier frequency offsets. The correction of the delays requires only few bits of feedback and the correction of the frequency offset can be entirely realized at the UE side. These results demonstrate that FBMC is a suitable technique for DL CoMP cellular systems.},

  abstract      = {Filter Bank based Multicarrier (FBMC) with Offset- QAM (O-QAM) modulation is one of the strong candidates for the physical layer of 5-th generation mobile communication systems. The combination of FBMC/OQAM with multiple antennas in a multi-user scheme poses some challenges towards the design of equalizers and precoders due to the frequency overlapping of the sub-carriers, especially in environments with highly frequency selective channels. In this work we first calculate a fractionally spaced Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)-based equalizer design to accommodate multi-user (MU) Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO)-FBMC. Then, we apply the Mean Square Error (MSE)-duality to calculate the corresponding precoders for MU Multiple Input Single Output (MISO)-FBMC. Furthermore, we present four possibilities for the power allocation between users and sub-carriers. We finally show the performance superiority of the new method compared to a recently proposed method.},

  abstract      = {Filter bank multicarrier systems, similarly to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), are very sensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO) and symbol timing offset (STO). In this paper, a low-complexity preamble-based joint CFO and STO technique is presented. It is based on a relatively long preamble in order to improve the CFO estimation performance as well as avoid interference coming from the data following this preamble. After CFO and STO correction, the preamble can be reused to estimate the channel. Unlike most current techniques, the CFO and STO estimation occurs in the frequency domain. This allows for a low-complexity estimation with respect to time-domain techniques and, as will be shown by simulations, provide even better performance in a reasonable range. The drawback however is that the estimation range is shorter. Specifically, for large STOs (and to a smaller extent large CFOs), the performance decreases below time-domain estimations. Two versions of the STO estimation technique will be presented, the second one being an approximation of the first one, making it less complex yet also less precise. The performance is assessed by means of computer simulations, testing for both large and small STOs, and compared with existing techniques.},

In comparison, equalization has been a sticking issue for filter bank multicarrier systems, because of performance and implementation aspects. In contrast, equalization is straightforward to implement in OFDM systems and it is easy to figure out the performance achieved, thanks to the presence of the cyclic prefix. Here, OFDM and FBMC/OQAM systems are compared for timing offset equalization, which is representative of global channel equalization and appears as such in some use cases, e.g. asynchronous access. The single tap equalizer and the multitap time-domain equalizer are analyzed for a specific, yet representative, FBMC scheme. It is shown that multitap time-domain timing-offset sub-channel equalization brings improvements over single-tap equalization but its discrete time nature limits its performance. There is no such limitation in the frequency domain and a recently proposed implementation of the FBMC concept, named frequency spreading, is analyzed. Equipped with this receiver, an FBMC system can withstand any timing offset and, then, unlike OFDM, it is able, in a multicarrier context, to support asynchronous users while keeping spectral efficiency.},

The compensation method depends not only on the particular FBMC modulation technique but also on the chosen receiver structure. The paper is dedicated to the case where the recently proposed frequency-despreading receiver, one of the most promising solutions, is used in the OFDM/OQAM transceiver. Specifically, this receiver exploits some samples of an extended FFT and, as shown in the paper, it can nearly perfectly compensate the CFO effects on the received signal by adapting the weights of the linear combination of the considered samples. A detailed analysis of the frequency-despreading structure and of the proposed CFO-compensation technique is presented by using as performance measure the signal-to-interference ratio and the bit-error-rate.},

  abstract      = {Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier (UFMC) is a novel multi-carrier modulation technique which can be seen as a generalization of filtered OFDM and filter bank based multi-carrier (FBMC-FMT). Being a candidate waveform technology for 5G wireless systems, it combines the simplicity of OFDM with the advantages of FBMC. The FIR-filter, used in UFMC to filter a group of subcarriers, is a key design parameter to gain more robustness in relaxed synchronization conditions, i.e. time-frequency misalignment. It was shown in previous work that very significant SIR improvement can be achieved for UFMC by optimizing the FIR-filter, taking carrier frequency offset into account. In this paper, we optimize the FIR-filter design in UFMC by taking both carrier frequency and timing offset into account in an uplink multi-user FDMA scenario. From the simulation results, up to 3.6 dB SIR improvement can be achieved with the optimized FIR filter compared to UFMC with non-optimized Dolph-Chebyshev filter and 15.1 dB SIR gain against classical CP-OFDM system respectively, provided that the normalized carrier frequency and timing offset are uniformly distributed in the interval ±5{\%}.},

Iterative optimization of a surrogate function as exempli? ed by an EM algorithm does not necessarily require missing data. Indeed, every EM algorithm is a special case of the more general class of MM optimization algorithms, which typically exploit convexity rather than missing data in majoriz- ing or minorizing an objective function.

One of the characteristics of FBMC is that the received data are accompanied by a two dimensional inter-symbol interference term (2D ISI), which complicates MIMO techniques when combined with optimum detection. In this paper we consider the association of FBMC with the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique focusing on the spatial data multiplexing (SDM), and we investigate the use of Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Therefore, reliable and accurate synchronization algorithms must be designed for these systems. The approach herein presented is based on the deployment of appropriate training sequences. In particular, we propose a new joint symbol timing and CFO synchronization algorithm based on the least squares approach and exploiting the transmission of a training sequence made up of identical parts.

The 2×1 multi-user detection (MUD) case has been also addressed to certain extent. Additional gains, essentially related to SISO case, coming from the cooperative use of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) branches, primarily based on the quadrature noise components' independence, as well as from the explicit noise cancellation within the SIC framework, have also been outlined.},

A particular type of FBMC, the so-called FBMC/OQAM or OFDM/OQAM system, consisting of pulse shaped OFDM carrying offset QAM (OQAM) symbols, has received increasing attention due to, among other features, its higher spectral efficiency and implementation simplicity. It suffers, however, from an imaginary inter-carrier/inter-symbol interference that complicates signal processing tasks such as channel estimation. This paper focuses on channel estimation for OFDM/OQAM systems based on a known preamble. A review of the existing preamble structures and associated channel estimation methods is given, for both single- (SISO) and multiple-antenna (MIMO) systems. The various preambles are compared via simulations in both mildly and highly frequency selective channels. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Furthermore, with the proposed time domain model, the channel statistic information could be utilized to improve the performance of the channel estimation.

Simulation results demonstrate that the BCRB and CRB bounds could be achieved by the proposed LMMSE and WLS methods, respectively. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed methods are much robust to the time synchronization error compared to the conventional frequency domain methods, and imply that the pulse shaping filter with waveforms concentrated in the time domain could be employed in OQAM-OFDM systems to improve the channel estimation performance and spectral efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Reliable wireless communications often requires accurate knowledge of the underlying multipath channel. This typically involves probing of the channel with a known training waveform and linear processing of the input probe and channel output to estimate the impulse response. Many real-world channels of practical interest tend to exhibit impulse responses characterized by a relatively small number of nonzero channel coefficients. Conventional linear channel estimation strategies, such as the least squares, are ill-suited to fully exploiting the inherent low-dimensionality of these sparse channels. In contrast, this paper proposes sparse channel estimation methods based on convex/linear programming. Quantitative error bounds for the proposed schemes are derived by adapting recent advances from the theory of compressed sensing. The bounds come within a logarithmic factor of the performance of an ideal channel estimator and reveal significant advantages of the proposed methods over the conventional channel estimation schemes.},

We modeled two usage scenarios, crossroad and metropolitan street, using the CATIA V5 tool. Measurements for the VLC channel delay profile evaluation were then gathered by using a ray-tracing scheme employing commercial LightTools software under the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication links. From the obtained channel impulse responses from both scenarios, we derived the VLC channel delay profiles. From them, we found that the common property of the delay profile was composed of dominant multiple line of sight (LOS) links and a less number of non-LOS delay taps. However, the channel delay profile for the V2I link and metropolitan scenario show more dispersive channel characteristics due to the reflection and diffusion of the visible light.},

Recently, compressive sensing (CS) is explored to solve those problems, but it heavily relies on the sparsity level of the channel, which is unknown in practice. In this paper, a signal-to-noise ratio-based sparsity estimation method is proposed to detect the sparsity level of the channel. Then we propose the priori aided subspace pursuit algorithm if the channel sparsity meets the theoretical CS model, otherwise we use an improved iterative channel estimation method with the help of the channel sparsity.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT  The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation technique has been used widely in visible light communications (VLC) systems to combat intersymbol interference. At the same time, the inherent drawback of OFDM with a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is brought into OFDM visible light communications (VLC-OFDM). Furthermore, considering the limited dynamic range characteristics of light-emitting diodes, the performance degradation caused by a high PAPR is more serious in VLC-OFDM. In this paper, we propose a partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique based on the combination of a genetic algorithm (GA) and a hill-climbing algorithm (GH-PTS) to solve the problem of high PAPR. GH-PTS is a modified PTS technique based on GA-PTS. Essentially, GH-PTS is a local optimization of GA-PTS. Simulation results show that the optimized technique is able to reduce PAPR more effectively without any loss of bit error rate performance than the GA-PTS technique in VLC-OFDM system.},

The ICA algorithm is applied to separate the mixed signal at the receiving end directly without the requirement of the channel information. Simulation results show that this indoor MIMO VLC scheme can achieve excellent performance. When the signal-to-noise ratio is equal to 14 dB, the bit error ratio (BER) reaches the level of 10.

First, we derived a parametric channel model. Then, we used ESPRIT to obtain multipath channel parameters. After that, we built a dynamic over-complete dictionary that can be used in CS processing. Finally, we reconstructed the channel response by using a basis pursuit denoising algorithm to equalize the received signal in frequency domain. Compared with traditional schemes, the proposed scheme can improve channel estimation accuracy without increasing dictionary size. A set of computer simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.                       Figures in this Article        Conference Presentation Video        Visit SPIE.TV},

Although, the LS estimator has lower complexity and requires minimum knowledge the channel state information, the estimator suffers from inherent additive Gaussian noise and Inter Carrier Interference (ICI). Following that, in this study an efficient and improved channel estimation technique is proposed based on the LS algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs considerably better than the conventional LS method for a range of Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs). In addition, the performance of the proposed method is found to be almost equal, if compared with the MMSE estimator. Despite the proposed method experiences relatively higher computational complexity than the LS, the complexity is yet to be achieved about 40% lower than the MMSE.},

The real-time experimental laboratory setup was assembled to operate in conditions as realistic as possible by combining hardware prototypes for the broadband transmitters, commercial PMR terminals and a radio channel emulator (providing mobile channels conditions based on the Extended Pedestrian A specifications). The experimental results show that co-existence in a shared spectrum scenario is possible and that the performance degradation is kept at a low level, as long as the broadband transmission is making use of spectrally agile post-OFDM modulations such as filterbank multicarrier (FBMC).},

Requirement stems from the coexistence scheme used in this band between opportunistic transmission and TV broadcast signals (or wireless microphones). To ensure nonharmful interference of the TVWS signal on the incumbent services, a high adjacent leakage power ratio (ACLR) is expected. Also, flexibility is required to address the vacant channels in the UHF spectrum. Flexibility and low ACLR specifications are difficult to obtain simultaneously. The approach proposed in this paper is based on filter bank multi-carrier modulation (FBMC) scheme and a flexible hardware platform to combine the digital filtering capability of FBMC with RF agility. A FBMC hardware architecture implementation is presented and its associated complexity is studied for this platform. Then the hardware implementation validates that both flexibility and ACLR performance of the system are preserved even when off-the-shelf component impairments are considered. An experimental setup validates the coexistence with a TV broadcast signal and a comparison with a classical approach shows the gain in performance.},

The 3-dB analog modulation bandwidth of the TO-38-can packaged GaN blue LD biased at 65 mA and controlled at 25 degrees C is only 900 MHz, which can be extended to 1.5 GHz for OFDM encoding after throughput intensity optimization.

Besides gains in efficiency, mainly due to the absence of cyclic prefix, an important feature of FBMC is the absence of spectral leakage, which makes it particularly appealing for cognitive radio. However, in burst transmission, the filter impulse response introduces transitions which extend the length of the burst with respect to OFDM and may reduce the gains in efficiency. After a brief overview of the FBMC technique, the exploitation in burst transmission is discussed. The effect of cutting the initial and final transitions of the burst is investigated. The level of temporary spectral leakage introduced by this operation is assessed. It is shown that cuts leading to an increase in burst length of half a symbol with respect to OFDM affect the first and the last symbol only, resulting in a minor reduction in bit loading for these symbols. Application to the time division duplex access mode is considered, as well as the case of the presence of a preamble in the burst. For implementation, it is proposed to resort to a simple memory preloading technique, which has the advantage of compatibility with OFDM in dual mode systems.},

We refer to this as the coded auxiliary pilot (CAP) method. It builds on the idea of using a few auxiliary pilot (AP) symbols to eliminate the imaginary interference on each scattered pilot. At the same time, to keep the spectral efficiency of transmission high, the AP symbols are coded to also carry information symbols. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the CAP method can maintain high spectral efficiency and high power efficiency, while achieving complete imaginary interference cancelation. Taking the spectral and power efficiency, the imaginary interference cancelation performance, and the coding/decoding complexity into consideration, the CAP method with two to four AP symbols is identified as a good compromised choice for practice.},

  abstract = {Shaping the pulse of FilterBank MultiCarrier with Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation subcarrier modulation (FBMC-OQAM) systems offers a new degree of freedom for the design of mobile communication systems. In previous studies, we evaluated the gains arising from the application of Prototype Filter Functions (PFFs) and subcarrier spacing matched to the delay and Doppler spreads of doubly dispersive channels. In this work, we investigate the impact of having imperfect channel knowledge at the receiver on the performance of Channel Adaptive Modulation (CAM) in terms of channel estimation errors and Bit Error Rate (BER). To this end, the channel estimation error for two different interference mitigation schemes proposed in literature is derived analytically and its influence on the BER performance is analyzed for practical channel scenarios. Additionally, we verify the accuracy of considering the flat channel assumption within the direct neighborhood of a pilot symbol, which is made by most schemes discussed in literature. Two major key statements are drawn from the results. First, the results show that the aforementioned assumption is not valid for all scenarios. Second, channel adaptive FBMC-OQAM systems with scattered pilots based channel estimation provide a performance gain compared to the conventional "one-fitsall" approach used in combination with state-of-the-art interference mitigation schemes for embedded pilots.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT  Channel estimation in multicarrier systems employing filter banks with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM) is known to face challenges related to the interference effect intrinsic to these systems. Most of the methods reported thus far rely on the assumption of (almost) flat subchannels - implying a low frequency selective channel - to more easily tackle this problem. Others, more recent ones, relax this assumption but they either depend on a model for the channel or they concentrate on per-subchannel estimation and often require long training sequences. This paper revisits this problem by proposing a method that makes no assumption on the channel frequency selectivity, while using a very short preamble for training. The latter is optimized with respect to the channel estimation mean squared error. The superiority of the proposed method over classical ones is demonstrated via simulation results for both mildly and highly frequency selective channels.},

It suf-fers, however, from an inherent (intrinsic) imaginary inter-carrier/inter-symbol interference that complicates signal pro-cessing tasks such as channel estimation (CE). Recently, the so-called interference approximation method (IAM) was pro-posed for preamble-based CE. It relies on the knowledge of the pilot's neighborhood to approximate this interference and constructively exploit it in simplifying CE and improving its performance. The IAM preamble with nulls at the neigh-boring time instants that results in optimum CE performance was recently reported. This paper investigates an extended version of it, which can provide significant improvement through an appropriate exploitation of the interfering sym-bols from neighboring time instants as well. Simulation re-sults are presented that compare the methods, with each other and with CP-OFDM, in both mildly and highly frequency-selective channels.},

However with the property of real-field orthogonality of FBMC/OQAM systems, channel estimation under the intrinsic imaginary interference has been a fundamental obstacle. In this paper, we show that the existing pilot-based methods are trapped by the paradigm that the reference signal must include an independent prime pilot and rely on an auxiliary pilot to neutralize the interference on the prime pilot. By breaking this paradigm, we present a novel scheme, in which it gives up the independent pilot and derives dual dependent pilots from the imposed interference. By doing this, the interference between the dual dependent pilots can be fully utilized so that the efficiency of utilizing pilots can be boosted. Consequentially, the simulation results show that the new scheme outperforms the existing solutions.},

  abstract  = {Filter bank-based multicarrier (FBMC) has been considered as an attractive scheme alternative to the conventional OFDM with cyclic prefix (CP), especially in terms of the robustness against frequency offset and Doppler spread. However, due to the real-field orthogonality of FBMC signals, these classical OFDM channel estimation (CE) methods cannot be directly applied to FBMC systems. Focusing on existing preamble-based CE schemes for FBMC systems, all schemes require three real-valued symbol duration to transmit the preamble training symbols, whereas two real-valued symbol duration equivalent to one complex-valued symbol duration is only required in CP-OFDM systems. In this paper, we introduce a preamble design with auxiliary symbols for removing the intrinsic imaginary interference from neighboring data symbols. Compared with existing CE schemes, the superiority of auxiliary preamble method (APM) is with less time-frequency resource consumption of preamble training symbols, meanwhile without losing the accuracy of estimation performance. Numerical simulation and analysis demonstrate that the proposed APM is an efficient CE approach for practical preamble-based FBMC systems.},

The theoretical expression of the LMMSE channel estimation is formulated and a simpler closed-form is derived. The MSE analysis shows that LMMSE inevitably reaches an error floor due to the interference inherent to OFDM/OQAM modulation. Furthermore, an algorithm for the joint MMSE estimation of both the channel and the noise variance (J-MCNE) is proposed and features a reduced complexity thanks to the low-rank approximation method. The noise level estimation represents a challenge as it is concealed in the intrinsic interferences generated by the OFDM/OQAM. Simulations reveal the capability of the proposed J-MCNE method to estimate the noise variance and show that the achieved bit error rate (BER) is close to that of the perfect estimation.},
