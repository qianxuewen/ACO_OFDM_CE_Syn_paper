\begin{abstract}
To facilitate the development of asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) systems, a joint synchronization and channel estimation scheme is proposed. The preamble used in the scheme is based on zero correlation code pair (ZCC pair) and has impulse-like correlation relationship. This property can let the results of synchronization process be the coarsely estimated channel time response. Therefore the calculation results can be utilized for generating channel frequency response and this scheme reduces the calculation complexity. Also, a transceiver with low complexity is proposed. Compared to conventional transceiver, it just needs a half amount of multiplications. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme achieves better performance both in synchronization and channel estimation than existing schemes.

\section{Introduction}
Visual light communication (VLC) technology\cite{Chi2015,Qian2016Synchronisation} is a promising technique providing both illumination and ensuring data transmission at the same time. Besides, the light emitting diode (LED) as one of the most popular light sources can promote the widespread utilization of VLC systems. However, multi-path distortion caused by the glass reflections can heavily reduce the communication qualities. Thus, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique is introduced to combat the multi-path effect.

Due to intensity modulation and direct detection in most VLC systems, many OFDM-based VLC systems resort to the direct current bias optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) modulation, asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) and other schemes to enable signals to be positive. However, as revealed in \cite{Dissanayake2013Comparison}, it is better to choose ACO-OFDM scheme when constellations like quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 16QAM are exploited since ACO-OFDM scheme has higher optical power efficiency especially for some scenarios such as Internet of Things (IoT) systems.

In IoT systems, low complexity is essential to the implementation of ACO-OFDM systems. Also, to lower power consumption and achieve higher data rates, ACO-OFDM schemes are integrated to develop other modulation techniques, such as asymmetrically clipped DC-biased optical OFDM (ADO-OFDM), hybrid ACO-OFDM (HACO-OFDM) and layered ACO-OFDM (LACO-OFDM)\cite{Wang2017Optical}. To facilitate the implementation of these modulation techniques, ACO-OFDM schemes with low complexity must be researched.

It is well known that OFDM systems are sensitive to synchronization errors and are heavily affected by the complex channels. Much researches focus on making use of the preamble symbols to synchronize signals and estimate channel frequency response at the same time. Like systems in radio communication systems, the channel state information (CSI) is estimated via preamble symbols in time domain and the channel frequency response can be calculated by using CSI.

In \cite{Tian2008}, Tian et. al. proposed a scheme based on the symmetric symbols. However, this scheme has low estimation precision and the side-lobes are high. In \cite{Ranjha2015}, Ranjha et. al proposed a new timing metric with synchronization performance enhancement but the scheme still has large side-lobes. Aspired in \cite{Qian2017}, modified zero correlation code (ZCC) pair symbols designed based on Physical layer for dynamic spectrum access and cognitive radio (PHYDYAS) \cite{Bellanger2010} filters have impulse-like aperiodic correlation results and are used to estimate CSI to perform channel estimation in DCO-OFDM systems. This kind of technique can also be applied to ACO-OFDM channel estimation and synchronization.

In this letter, the ACO-OFDM system is firstly investigated and a new transceiver is proposed to reduce the calculation complexity. After that a joint synchronization and channel estimation algorithm based on ZCC pair is proposed for ACO-OFDM system.
The rest is organized as follows. In Section II, the system model is presented, including the channel model, ACO-OFDM-based VLC system and the new transmitter and receiver. Then, the joint synchronization and channel estimation algorithm is proposed in Section III. In Section IV, performance and simulation results are analysed. In the end, the conclusion is drawn in Section V.

\section{System Model}

	\subsection{VLC Channel Model}
		A realistic VLC channel is determined by many factors, such as realistic light source, different types of reflections and the light wavelength. As simulated in \cite{Uysal2015Lifi}, the maximum path delay in home environment is about 60ns and there is often one  line of sight (LOS) response while the NLOS responses are extremely small. However in manufacturing cell environment, the maximum path delay may exceed 80ns. Also, there are more strong  responses as many light traces are reflected by metal materials and NLOS responses cannot be neglected.
		
		The VLC channel can be modeled as
        \begin{equation}\label{channel_model}
          h(\tau)=\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}g(l)\delta(\tau-\tau_l),
        \end{equation}
        where $g(l)$ and $\tau_l$ denote the gain and delay of the l-th transmission path, $\delta(\tau)$ denotes the Dirac function and $L$ represents the number of path.
        $h(\tau)$ can be made discrete at a sampling speed. For simplicity, we assume that $\tau_l$ is an integer.
        Since VLC systems can only transfer intensity signals, $g(l)\geq0$.

    \subsection{ACO-OFDM-based VLC system}
		Considering a ACO-OFDM system with N sub-carriers, the signal after IFFT is given as
		\begin{equation}\label{equ:ACO_OFDM_base}
          x(n)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}X_{i}e^{j2\pi\frac{ni}{N}},-N_{CP}\leq n \leq N-1,
        \end{equation}
        where $n$ denotes the index of signal in time domain and $X_{i}$ denotes the modulated data on the k-th sub-carrier. The $N_{CP}$ represents CP length.
        To make $x(n)$ be real, $X_{i}$ must follow the Hermite symmetry property which is shown as
		\begin{equation}\label{equ:Hermite_symmetry}
          X=[X_0,X_1,\ldots,X_{N/2-1},X(N/2),X_{N/2-1}^{*},\ldots,X_{1}^{*}].
        \end{equation}
		In ACO-OFDM systems, only the odd sub-carriers are used and the even sub-carriers are set to zero so that $ x(n)=-x(n+N/2) $ when $
0\leq n\leq N/2-1 $. In this way, $ x(n) $ can be clipped at zero to be $ x_c(n) $ without information loss. Then, the cyclic prefix (CP) is introduced to overcome the multipath channel.

		The effect of multipath channel can be written as
        \begin{equation}\label{equ:multipath_effect}
          y(n)=\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}h(l)x_c(n-\tau_l)+w(n),
        \end{equation}
        where $h(l)$ represents the VLC channel time domain response and $w(n)$ denotes the total noise consist of the ambient light shot noise and thermal noise which can be modeled as white Gaussian noise\cite{Narmanlioglu2015}.

		
	\subsection{Simplified Transmitter and Receiver}
		Since the original signals are clipped at zero, the direct FFT results of $ x_c(n) $ are not the same as that of $ x(n) $, but the odd sub-carriers are not distorted. Only the odd sub-carriers are necessary.
		
		If we denote $ C $ as the first half of the $ x(n) $, then $ x=[C;-C] $. And if we denote $ A $ and $ B $ as the first half and second half of the $ x_c(n) $, then $ C = A - B $. Thus, when the $ C $ is generated via IFFT process of $ N/2 $ length, the whole $ x(n) $ can be obtained without using IFFT process of $ N $ length which lower the calculation complexity.
		
		For $ 0\leq n \leq N/2-1 $, $ C $ can be generated via		
		\begin{eqnarray}\label{equ:sim_transmitter}
			x(n) &=& \sum_{i=0}^{N/2-1} X_{2i+1}e^{j\frac{2\pi}{N}n(2i+1)} \nonumber\\
				 &=& \sum_{k=0}^{N/2-1} X_{k} e^{j\frac{2\pi}{N/2}nk}e^{j\frac{2\pi}{N}n} \nonumber\\
				 &=& IFFT(X)_{N/2}e^{j\frac{2\pi}{N}n},
		\end{eqnarray}
		where $ IFFT(\cdot)_{N/2} $	represents the IFFT process of $ N/2 $ length.	There are $ N/2 log_2(N/2) + N/2 = N/2 log_2(N) $ multiplications used in generation of $ C $ which is just a half of that of conventional method $( N log_2(N) )$.
		
		For the receiver, the results of the FFT process must be multiplied with 2 due to the signal clipping which is pointed in many papers \cite{Wang2017Optical}. Since only the odd sub-carriers are necessary, thus the received data on the $ 2i+1 $ sub-carrier can be obtained as
        \begin{small}
		\begin{eqnarray}\label{equ:sim_receiver}
			X_{2i+1} &=& \frac{2}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} y(n) e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}n(2i+1)}\nonumber\\
					 &=& \frac{2}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1} y(n) e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}n(2i+1)}  \nonumber\\
					 &&+ \frac{2}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1} y(n+N/2) e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}(n+N/2)(2i+1)} \nonumber\\
					 &=& \frac{2}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1} y(n) e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}n(2i+1)}  \nonumber\\
					 &-& \frac{2}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1} y(n+N/2) e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}n(2i+1)} \nonumber\\
					 &=& \frac{2}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1} ( y(n)-y(n+N/2) ) e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}n(2i+1)}  \nonumber\\
					 %&=& \sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1} ( y(n)-y(n+N/2) ) e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}n} e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N/2}ni} \nonumber\\
					 &=& FFT( ( y(n)-y(n+N/2) ) e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}n} )_{N/2},
		\end{eqnarray}
        \end{small}
		where $ FFT(\cdot)_{N/2} $	represents the FFT process of $ N/2 $ length. Just as the proposed transmitter, the calculation complexity of proposed receiver is half that of conventional receiver.

\section{Synchronization and Channel Estimation Scheme with Low Complexity Transceiver}		
	In \cite{Qian2016Synchronisation}, zero-correlation-code (ZCC) pair is proposed to synchronize signal in DCO-OFDM-based VLC systems. In \cite{Qian2017}, modified ZCC pair generated via PHYDYAS filters can be used to obtain the gains and delays of the multi-path channels. There is no frequency offset in VLC systems due to the intensity modulation and demodulation property. This makes synchronization and channel estimation process easier than systems in radio communications. Unlike DCO-OFDM systems, the transmitted signals of ACO-OFDM systems are clipped at zero from the data generated after IFFT process. It is hard to exploit ZCC pair sequences in ACO-OFDM systems directly. To reserve the impulse-like correlation property of ZCC pair sequences so that the CSI can be estimated via synchronization process, the received signals must be investigated.
	
	The following is to show that $ y(n)-y(n+N/2) $ contains $ C $.
	%If $C$ is generated to be ZCC pair sequence,
	We denote the $A^{'}$ and $A^{''}$ as the parts of the delayed $A$ and denote  $B^{'}$ and $B^{''}$ as the parts of the delayed $B$ and delayed CP.
	By investigating the effect of multi-path channels,
	\begin{figure}[htb]
		\centering \includegraphics[width=6cm]{effect_of_channel_ACO_OFDM.eps}
		\caption{The illustration for the effect of multipath channels on symbols} \label{fig:effect_of_channel_ACO_OFDM}
	\end{figure}
	Since $C^{'}=A^{'}-B^{'}$ and $C^{''}=A^{''}-B^{''}$, the results of $y(n)-y(n+N/2)$ are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:effect_of_channel_ACO_OFDM}.
	
	If $C$ and $D$ are set to be the ZCC pair sequence and the pair sequence, the aperiodic correlation between $C$ and $D$ is impulse-like.
	%Since there is no frequency offset in VLC systems,
	%As shown in \cite{Qian2017}, the
	Because $ \sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1}C(n+k)D^*(n)=N/2 \delta(k) $, the CSI can be estimated via
	\begin{small}
	\begin{eqnarray}\label{equ:gain_acquire}
          \bar{h}(k)&=&\frac{2}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1}(y(n+k)-y(n+k+N/2))D^*(n)\nonumber\\
          &=&\frac{2}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1}\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}(h(l)(x(n+k-l)-x(n+k-l+N/2))\nonumber\\
          &&+w(n+k-l)-w(n+k-l+N/2))D^*(n)\nonumber\\
          &=&\frac{2}{N}\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}h(l)\sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1}C(n+k-l)D^*(n)+\tilde{w}(k)\nonumber\\
          &=&\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}h(l)\delta(k-l)+\tilde{w}(k).
    \end{eqnarray}
	\end{small}
    %where $\tilde{w}(k)$ denotes the noise.

    The next step is to design the required preamble sequence for synchronization and channel estimation. %According to Eq.(\ref{equ:sim_transmitter}), all the sub-carriers are needed to generate $ C $. to some extent.

	The detailed steps to generate $ C $ is listed as:

    Step1: Define $S$ as a vector of $N/16+1$ length consisting of $1$ and $-1$:
        $S=[1, \cdots 1, \cdots -1, \ldots -1]^T$.

    Step2: $S$ is multiplied by a matrix $diag([1,j,-1,j^3,\ldots j^{N/16-1},j^{N/16}])$ to be $S_{a}$. This is also called offset quadrature amplitude modulation process.

    Step3: Define $S_b$ as a vector with Hermite property via

        $S_b=[S_{a}(0),S_{a}(1),\cdots S_{a}(N/16),S_{a}^*(N/16-1),\cdots S_{a}^*(1)]^T$.

	Step4: Inverse Fourier transform the $S_b$ to be $S_c$.

    Step5: Finally, we get the required sequence $C$ via $C=[ S_c; S_c; S_c; S_c]\cdot g$. The $g$ is given in \cite{Bellanger2010}.

    According to the relationship of ZCC pair sequence, $D$ is in fact the same as $C$ generated by using PHYDYAS filters. Thus, the preamble in the proposed algorithm is designed according to $C$ and the timing offset estimation metric is expressed as:
    \begin{eqnarray}\label{equ:synchronization}
          M(k)&=&\frac{2}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N/2-1}(y(n)-y(n+N/2))C^*(n).
    \end{eqnarray}

    Since the $ h $ is positive, the negative values in $ \bar{h} $ (obtained from Eq.(\ref{equ:synchronization}) ) are set to zero to be $ h^{'} $. After the CSI is acquired, the channel frequency response can be calculated via
    \begin{equation}\label{equ:Channel_Fre}
          H(k)=\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}h^{'}e^{-j2\pi\frac{\tau_l k}{N}},0\leq k \leq N-1.
    \end{equation}
    Also, only the odd sub-carriers are transmitting data. Therefore the simplified channel frequency response is expressed as
    \begin{equation}\label{equ:Channel_Fre_sim}
          H(2k+1)=\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}(h^{'}e^{-j2\pi\frac{\tau_l}{N}})e^{-j2\pi\frac{\tau_l k}{N/2}},0\leq k\leq N/2-1.
    \end{equation}
    The calculation complexity of Eq.(\ref{equ:Channel_Fre_sim}) is just half of Eq.(\ref{equ:Channel_Fre}).

    The received data in frequency domain can be equalized as
    \begin{equation}\label{equ:equalizer}
       X^{'}(2k+1)=\dfrac{2Y(2k+1)}{H(2k+1)},0\leq k\leq N/2-1.
    \end{equation}

    The whole simplified ACO-OFDM system is depict in Fig.\ref{fig:sim_ACO_OFDM_system}.
    \begin{figure*}[!htb]
    	\centering \includegraphics[width=12cm,height=4cm]{ACO_OFDM_system.eps}
		\caption{The illustration for the simplified ACO-OFDM system} \label{fig:sim_ACO_OFDM_system}
    \end{figure*}
    The IFFT and FFT process in the system are of $ N/2 $ length. After the generation of $ C $, the positive and negative of $ C $ are used to compose the ACO-OFDM symbol and the CP is added before transmitted by optical transmitters. The received signals are firstly subtracted by the signal $ y(n+N/2) $. The results are used to calculate the right timing point via Eq.(\ref{equ:synchronization}). When the right timing point is acquired, the needed channel frequency response is calculated via Eq.(\ref{equ:Channel_Fre_sim}) after the negative part of the synchronization results are set to zero. In the end, the data are equalized according to Eq.(\ref{equ:equalizer}).

    \end{figure}
    Fig.\ref{fig:synchronization_mse} shows that the MSE value of timing offset estimation normalized to the IFFT length. The MSE values of the three scheme decrease with enlarging the SNR value. The Tian's scheme \cite{Tian2008} achieves the worst performance compared with the Ranjha's \cite{Ranjha2015} and proposed schemes. When the SNR is low, the Ranjha's scheme has better performance but the performance difference is small. However, when SNR value is large, the estimation error is just $ \dfrac{1}{3} $ of that of Ranjha's scheme.
    %As to the calculation complexity, the Tian's scheme needs $ N/2-2 $ multiplications at each discrete sample time, while Bilal's \cite{Ranjha2015} and proposed schemes both need
    Thus, the proposed scheme is the best.

    Fig.\ref{fig:channel_estimation_HMSE} is the figure to compare channel frequency response estimation performance. As shown in the figure, the channel frequency estimation MSE value of LS scheme decreases with enlarging SNR with steady slope, while the MSE value of proposed scheme drops gradually to a level but is much lower than that of LS scheme. Furthermore, the original data come from the synchronization results. Most calculation can be done via the system FFT module. Only $ N/2 $ multiplications are needed for the simplified channel frequency response. The proposed scheme has better channel estimation performance than LS scheme.

	Overall, the proposed joint synchronization and channel estimation scheme has better performance than other schemes.

\section{Conclusion}
In this letter, a joint synchronization and channel estimation scheme is proposed for ACO-OFDM systems. Also, simplified transceiver is proposed which only needs half that calculations compared with conventional transceiver. Simulations have revealed that the proposed scheme has better performance than other schemes and only needs a small amount of calculations to perform the whole task.
